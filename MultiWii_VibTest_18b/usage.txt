Project: MustiWii_VibTest Arduino Project
Author:  C. Witte (Gartenflieger2)
Created: 02-JUL-2011
Status:  28-JUL-2011
Version: 18b (Serial Datagram Version 18, Subversion b)

The purpose of this software is to enable Vibration monitoring and common ESC setup of a multicopter based on the 
MultiWii project.

It is based on the MultiWii_dev20110629 and the serial module of the dev_20010706 and should 
(hopefully) work with the MultiWiiConf_18 user interface software. It is compatible to serial of dev_20110714, 
which is already marked as 18.

What's new in 18b:

 - Upon startup no motor is active, you have to toggle the motor number first before you can test the first one. 
   This is a safety feature.
 - A new ESC setup function was implemented: If THROTTLE is > MAXTEST, the controller enters the setup mode and 
   ESCs are driven with 2000. On most ESCs this will put them into programing mode. After that, the THROTTLE value
   is forwarded to all ESCs (1000 for < MINTEST, 2000 for > MAXTEST) so you can follow any ESC progamming sequence
   foe all ESCs simultaneously. Owners of OCTOs will appreciate this function more than owners of a BI, I guess.

The plan is as follows:

 Using the RC control rudder/yaw, the motors are activated one after the other. RC control throttle is then used to 
 drive the motor at diffent speeds.

 In the GUI the values for the Gyro and Acc values (are abused to) represent the vibration level of each sensor. 
 It is obtained by computing the residual of the true values from the smoothed ones.

Usage: (how it is planned)

1. Setup and flash this software using the Arduino22 program. 

2. Hook up copter to PC, launch MultiWiiConf UI Version dev_20110706 (later 18). Set RC THROTTLE->Min !! and power up 
   copter to enter vibration monitoring mode, or set RC THROTTLE->Max !! and power up to enter ESC setup mode.

3. Select motor to spin using RUDD->MIN/MAX. LED13 will blink according to motor number and the motor number is shown in the right Debug field.

4. Use THROTTLE to control speed and monitor vibration levels.

5. Apply or remove balancing tape to/from prop.

6. Repeat steps 3. to 5. until satisfied with the results.

7. Swith to next motor using THROTTLE->Min and RUDD->MIN/MAX. Next Motor will spin up at MIN_THROTTLE.

8. Repeat steps until all motors/props are balanced.


##############################################################

Done already:

 - program motor activation sequence
 - test motor activation sequence
 - program vibration monitoring
 - test vibration monitoring
 - program common ESC setup (like as hanging on a normal receiver) using THROTTLE->max on startup
 - test common ESC setup

Tests done on QuadX w/ WMP clone and BMA020

Left to do:

 - change motor activation sequence to blink more slowly

 - modify sensor initialistion to not use low-pass filters
